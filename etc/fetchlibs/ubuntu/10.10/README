This directory contains files to set up an Ubuntu 10.10 installation so that frameworks, libraries and projects developed at the RRLAB can be compiled and run.

First you should install rrlab-dependencies-common_1.0-1_i386.deb.
This is a meta-package and will install all relevant libraries available through apt and the standard Ubuntu repositories.

The fetch-<libname> can then be used to acquire additional libraries.
They are downloaded from the internet and - in the case of source code - compiled and installed.

Note: Libraries are installed using "sudo make install" or by copying stuff to "/usr/local". This is not really clean - because no package management is involved. However, I'm not sure whether it's worth spending the time to do this properly. I'm pretty happy as it is.
