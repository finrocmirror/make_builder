Turbo-charged MCA Builder - Copyright 2008 by Max Reichardt

This is an experimental build tool for MCA.
It compiles MCA projects comparably fast by merging source 
files to few large source files before compiling.

(the following information is slightly outdated...)

It should be called from the MCAHOME directory.

Syntax: turbobuild [options] <project name>

 If project name is 'all' all projects in the 'projects' 
 subdirectory are compiled.

options:
 --jobs=<n>      If this parameter is specified, the actual calls 
                 to 'gcc' are decoupled from preprocessing and
                 executed by n independent threads.
 --kernel=<path> Compile with alternative MCA kernel in <path>.
 --build=<name>  Compiled Binaries are placed in path export/<name>
                 Default name is 'experimental'.
 --so			 Compile parts to shared objects (instead of 
                 executables)
 --notests       Do not compile test parts (minor speedup).
 --make          Create make file in current directory instead of
                 compiling directly.

Config Files: 

 config.h      config.h file that is prepended to each source file

 libdb.raw     Raw Library "database". Each line stands for one 
               external library.
               Format: <libname>: <compiler flags>
               If the 'compiler flags' are 'N/A' this indicates that
               the library is not available.
               '$MCAHOME$' is replaced with the MCA root directory.
               
 libdb.txt     Library database generated from libdb.raw using the
               updatelibdb command.

 critical.txt  Contains names of source files that need to be compiled
               separately (in rare cases this is necessary - because of 
               namespace issues and unhandled duplicate declarations)
